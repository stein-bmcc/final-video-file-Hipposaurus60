    <p>You stand in front of the King, who offers you a critical mission. The fate of the kingdom may rest on your shoulders. Will you accept the task and embark on this dangerous journey, or will you refuse, choosing to stay out of the conflict?</p>

        <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="pagethree.html"><strong>Accept the request</strong>
           <p>You take a deep breath and agree to the King’s request, knowing that the kingdom’s future may depend on your actions. You are ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead, even if it means risking your life.</p>
        </a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="squidle.html"><strong>Decline the request</strong>
           <p>You decline the King’s request, unwilling to risk your life for a cause that is not your responsibility. Perhaps another path will reveal itself, one that doesn’t involve so much danger and uncertainty.</p>
